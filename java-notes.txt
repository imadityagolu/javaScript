// JavaScript // 
is a programming language that allows developers to create interactive web pages.

  
--the purpose of javascript in web development are
Javascript is a client-side scripting language that's a core technology of the World Wide Web.
JavaScript is based on the syntax of Java and C 
it supports object-oriented programming with classes and object prototypes

  
--importance of javascript in modern web applications are
JavaScript variables store data values
its functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks

  
--it enhances interactivity and functionality on websites
by events having actions that happen in the browser, such as mouse clicks and keyboard input

  
--Highlighting the key benefits of javascript, such as:

Speed= due to its "Just-in-Time" (JIT) compilation feature, which allows the browser to optimize and compile JavaScript code on the fly during execution

Versatility(front-end and back-end usage)= thanks to the technology "Node.js" which allows JavaScript code to run on the server side, enabling developers to write code for the entire application using a single language, creating a unified development experience across the whole application stack

Community and ecosystem= it refers to the vast collection of developers, libraries, frameworks, tools, and resources that surround the JavaScript programming language, allowing developers to build web applications with a wide range of functionalities by utilizing readily available components
prominent examples include React, Angular, Node.js, and NPM (Node Package Manager), etc

Browser support and widespread use= many web browsers are built using javascrip example chrome its is 90% build by using javascrip because it helps the browser to understand the code of html css and javascript to perform better when user is interacting with any website 


--JavaScript stands out as a versatile, client-side scripting language primarily used for web development, making it distinct from other languages by being directly interpreted by browsers, allowing for dynamic and interactive web experiences, while most other languages require server-side compilation; it's considered easy to learn due to its relatively simple syntax

  
--Many popular websites and applications utilize JavaScript extensively, including: Google, YouTube, Facebook, Wikipedia, Amazon, Netflix, eBay, Reddit, Twitter, etc

  
--JavaScript frameworks provide structure and pre-written code to streamline web development. They offer solutions for common tasks like managing data, handling user interactions, and building user interfaces, which accelerates the development process 
examples are--

react= Primarily used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications, with a component-based architecture.

angular= it is A comprehensive framework for building complex web applications, offering features like data binding, routing, and dependency injection.

node.js= A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed server-side, enabling the development of backend applications and APIs.
etc
  

JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.

it can update and change both HTML and CSS.

JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data. its a very powerful programming language till date for creating web pages and development.


// SYNTAX //
console.log(Hello World");
- to print output in console area

document.write("Hello World");
- to print output in web area

alert("Hello");
- to print message in pop up dialogue box

confirm("Are you single?"); 
- to get boolen answer as an input from the user

prompt("what is your name?");
- to get string answer as an input from the user


// variables :- container which hold information
note:
default datatype is string but can be changed to any other

var a = 1/1000/7.69/"Addu"; (default datatype)
let a = 1/1000/7.69/"Addu"/true;


-the difference between var & let
1. Redecleration -> var(!) let(x) = because it overwrites 
2. Memory leak -> not visible to anyone by using scope {}, var is global



// Datatypes //
const x = 1; (value will be never changed)
Array = [];
object = {};


// To add javascript file in html page //
<script src="javascript.js"></script>
note:-
script tag is added after the body ends



// creating function in js //
! without parameter
function NAME ()
{
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
console.log(a+b);
}
NAME(); -> to call the function


! with parameters
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
function NAME (a,b)
{
console.log(a+b);
}
NAME(a,b); -> to call the function with parameters


! with return values
function NAME(a=1, b=2)
{
return a+b;
}
console.log(NAME(10,50));

note:-
a=1, b=2 -> is given as a default value, it can be any value




// pre-defined syntax //
~ str.length;
-> will return the length of the string

~ str.IndexOf("VALUE");
-> will give the position of the inputted value

~ str.lastIndexOf("VALUE");
-> will return the last occurrence of the value

~ str.indexOf("VALUE", POSITION);
-> position declaration will start searching from that index value(default is -1)

~ includes("VALUE");
-> will give a boolean result if that is available in it

~ includes("VALUE", POSITION);
-> position declaration will start searching from that index value
